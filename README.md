This is the web front-end of a tool for people to better understand their weather in a historical context.  People often think their weather is strange, but it's really hard to know.  This site uses a number of data sources to put the weather in a historical context.

Built on Boostrap 4 with [this simple template](https://www.bootply.com/108614).

## Site Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), with the add-in of [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.com).  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
